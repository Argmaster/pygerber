PyGerber package documentation
==============================

PyGerber is a Python library for 2D and 3D rendering of Gerber X3 files.
It is completely written in Python, and only dependencies are limiting its portability.

Constructive Criticism
----------------------

I would like to point out that this is the first extensive documentation
I have ever written, so I would be very grateful for any constructive criticism.
