# Introduction

Welcome to the Gerber Optimizer documentation. This documentation is intended to provide
a comprehensive overview of the Gerber Optimizer including usage, options and examples.

Unfortunately, the Gerber Optimizer is not yet implemented and documentation is yet to
be written. I am doing my best to provide it before release 3.0.0, stay tuned!
