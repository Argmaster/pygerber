# ðŸ¤§ Migrating from 2.4.x to 3.x.x

PyGerber 3.0.0 is a major rewrite of the library. Most of the library was rewritten from
scratch, a lot of nomenclature has changes and layout of the library has been
reorganized. This document is intended to provide a help in navigating through the
changes and migrating your code from 2.4.x to 3.x.x. We are especially concerned with
the introspection/analysis APIs which were significantly simplified.

Unfortunately, this documentation is yet to be written. I am doing my best to provide it
before release 3.0.0 so stay tuned!
