# Introduction

Welcome to the Gerber code analysis documentation. This documentation is intended to
provide a friendly guide to the APIs within PyGerber which can be used to analyze Gerber
files.

Unfortunately, this documentation is yet to be written. I am doing my best to provide it
before release 3.0.0 so stay tuned!
