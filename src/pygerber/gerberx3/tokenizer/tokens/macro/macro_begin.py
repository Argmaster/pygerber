    """## 4.5 Aperture Macro (AM).

    The AM command creates a macro aperture `template` and adds it to the aperture `template`
    dictionary (see 2.2). A `template` is a parametrized shape. The AD command instantiates a
    `template` into an aperture by supplying values to the template `parameters`.

    Templates of any shape or parametrization can be created. Multiple simple shapes called
    `primitives` can be combined in a single `template`. An aperture macro can contain `variables`
    whose actual values are defined by:

    - Values provided by the AD command
    - `Arithmetic expressions` with other `variables`

    The template is created by positioning `primitives` in a coordinate space. The origin of that
    coordinate space will be the origin of all apertures created with the state.

    A `template` must be defined before the first AD that refers to it. The AM command can be used
    multiple times in a file.

    `Attributes` are not attached to templates. They are attached to the aperture at the time of its
    creation with the AD command.

    An AM command contains the following words:

    - The AM declaration with the macro name
    - `Primitives` with their comma-separated `parameters`
    - `Macro variables`, defined by an `arithmetic expression`

    Coordinates and sizes are expressed in the unit set by the MO command.

    A parameter can be either:

    - A `decimal` number
    - A `macro variable`
    - An `arithmetic expression`

    A `macro variable` name must be a "$" character followed by an integer >0, for example `$12`.
    (This is a subset of names allowed in 3.4.3.)

    ## Example

    The following AM command defines an aperture macro named "Triangle_30".

    ```gerber
    %AMTriangle_30*
    4,1,3,
    1,-1,
    1,1,
    2,1,
    1,-1,
    30*
    %
    ```
