    ### LS Command: Scaling Graphics State Parameter

    The `LS` command is employed to establish the scaling graphics state parameter.

    Functionality:
    - The command dictates the scale factor utilized during object creation.
    - The aperture undergoes scaling, anchored at its origin. It's crucial to note that
        this origin might not always align with its geometric center.

    Usage and Persistence:
    - The `LS` command can be invoked multiple times within a single file.
    - Once set, the object scaling retains its value unless a subsequent `LS` command
        modifies it.
    - The scaling gets adjusted based on the specific value mentioned in the command and
        doesn't accumulate with the preceding scale factor.

    The LS command was introduced in revision 2016.12.

    See section 4.9.5 of The Gerber Layer Format Specification Revision 2023.03 - https://argmaster.github.io/pygerber/latest/gerber_specification/revision_2023_03.html
