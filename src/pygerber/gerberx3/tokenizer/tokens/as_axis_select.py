"""### Load Name (LN).

Note: The LN command was deprecated in revision I4 from October 2013.

The historic `LN` command doesn't influence the image in any manner and can safely be
overlooked.

Function of the `LN` command:
- `LN` is designed to allocate a name to the following section of the file.
- It was originally conceptualized to serve as a human-readable comment.
- For creating human-readable comments, it's advisable to utilize the standard `G04`
    command.
- The `LN` command has the flexibility to be executed multiple times within a file.

    The AS command is deprecated since revision I1 from December 2012.

    The historic AS command sets the correspondence between the X, Y data axes and the
    A, B output device axes. It does not affect the image in computer to computer data
    exchange. It only has an effect how the image is positioned on an output device.

    The order of execution is always MI, SF, OF, IR and AS, independent of their order
    of appearance in the file.

    The AS command can only be used once, at the beginning of the file.

    ### 8.1.2.1 AS Command.

    The syntax for the AS command is:

    ```ebnf
    AS = '%' (AS' ('AXBY'|'AYBX')) '*%';
    ```

    - `AS` - AS for Axis Select
    - `AXBY` - Assign output device axis A to data axis X, output device axis B to data axis Y. This is the default.
    - `AYBX` - Assign output device axis A to data axis Y, output device axis B to data axis X.

    ---

    ## Example

    Assign output device axis A to data axis X and output device axis B
    to data axis Y

    ```gerber
    %ASAXBY*%
    ```

    Assign output device axis A to data axis Y and output device axis B
    to data axis X

    ```gerber
    %ASAYBX*%
    ```
