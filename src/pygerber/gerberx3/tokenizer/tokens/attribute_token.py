    """## 5.1 Attributes Overview,.

    Attributes add meta-information to a Gerber file. Attributes are akin to labels providing
    information about the file or features within them. Examples of meta-information conveyed by
    attributes are:

    - The function of the file in the layer structure. Is the file the top solder mask, the bottom
    copper layer, â€¦?
    - The function of a pad. Is the pad an SMD pad, or a via pad, or a fiducial, ...?

    The attribute syntax provides a flexible and standardized way to add meta-information to a
    Gerber file, independent of the specific semantics or application.

    Attributes do not affect the image. A Gerber reader will generate the correct image if it simply
    ignores the attributes.

    Each attribute consists of an attribute name and an optional attribute value:

    ```ebnf
    <Attribute> = <AttributeName>[,<AttributeValue>]*
    ```

    Attribute names follow the name syntax in section 3.4.3.

    The attribute value consists of one or more comma-separated fields, see section 3.4.4.

    ```ebnf
    <AttributeValue> = <Field>{,<Field>}
    ```

    There are three types of attributes by the item they attach to:

    - `Attachment type` - The item to which they attach meta-information.
    - `File attributes` - Attach meta-information to the file as a whole.
    - `Aperture attributes` - Attach meta-information to an aperture or a region. Objects created by
    the aperture inherit the aperture meta-information.
    - `Object attributes` - Attach meta-information to on object directly.

    There are two types of attributes by the scope of their use:

    - `Standard attributes`. Standard attribute names, values and semantics are defined in this
    specification and are part of it. As they are standardized, they can exchange meta information between all applications.

    - `User attributes`. User attributes can be chosen freely by users to extend the format with
    custom meta-information. Use custom attributes only for unequivocally defined
    machine-readable information, use G04 for mere human-readable comments.

    In accordance with the general rule in 3.4.3 standard attribute names must begin with a dot "."
    while user attribute names cannot begin with a dot. The dot, if present, is part of the attribute
    name and indicates that it is a standard attribute whose syntax and semantics are defined in
    section 5.6.
