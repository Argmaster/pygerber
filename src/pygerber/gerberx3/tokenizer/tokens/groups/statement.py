    """## 3.3 Commands (`'%<something>%' - extended command`).

    Commands are the core syntactic element of the Gerber format. A Gerber file is a stream of
    commands. Commands define the graphics state, create graphical objects, defines apertures,
    manage attributes and so on.

    Commands are built with words, the basic syntactic building block of a Gerber file. A word is a
    non-empty character string, excluding the reserved characters '*' and '%', terminated with an '*'

    ```ebnf
    free_character = /[^%*]/; # All characters but * and %
    word = {free_character}+ '*';
    ```

    For historic reasons, there are two command syntax styles: word commands and extended
    commands.

    ```ebnf
    command =
    | extended_command
    | word_command
    ;
    word_command = word;
    extended_command = '%' {word}+ '%';
    ```

    (...)

    Extended commands are identified by a two-character command code that is followed by
    parameters specific to the code. An extended command is enclosed by a pair of "%" delimiters.

    An overview of all commands is in section 2.8, a full description in chapters 3.5 and 5.

    The example below shows a stream of Gerber extended commands.

    ## Example

    ```gerber
    %FSLAX26Y26*%
    %MOMM*%
    %AMDonut*
    1,1,$1,$2,$3*
    $4=$1x0.75*
    1,0,$4,$2,$3*
    %
    %ADD11Donut,0.30X0X0*%
    %ADD10C,0.1*%
    ```
