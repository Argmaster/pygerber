    """## 3.3 Commands (`'*' - end of command`).

    Commands are the core syntactic element of the Gerber format. A Gerber file is a stream of
    commands. Commands define the graphics state, create graphical objects, defines apertures,
    manage attributes and so on.

    Commands are built with words, the basic syntactic building block of a Gerber file. A word is a
    non-empty character string, excluding the reserved characters '*' and '%', terminated with an '*'

    ```ebnf
    word = {free_character}+ '*';
    ```

    For historic reasons, there are two command syntax styles: word commands and extended
    commands.

    (...)

    The example below shows a stream of Gerber commands.
