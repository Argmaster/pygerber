"""### Load Name (LN).

Note: The LN command was deprecated in revision I4 from October 2013.

The historic `LN` command doesn't influence the image in any manner and can safely be
overlooked.

Function of the `LN` command:
- `LN` is designed to allocate a name to the following section of the file.
- It was originally conceptualized to serve as a human-readable comment.
- For creating human-readable comments, it's advisable to utilize the standard `G04`
    command.
- The `LN` command has the flexibility to be executed multiple times within a file.

    The OF command is deprecated since revision I1 from December 2012.

    OF moves the final image up to plus or minus 99999.99999 units from the imaging
    device (0, 0) point. The image can be moved along the imaging device A or B axis,
    or both. The offset values used by OF command are absolute. If the A or B part is
    missing, the corresponding offset is 0. The offset values are expressed in units
    specified by MO command.  This command affects the entire image. It can only be
    used once, at the beginning of the file. The order of execution is always MI, SF,
    OF, IR and AS, independent of their order of appearance in the file.
