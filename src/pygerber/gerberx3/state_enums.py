    ### Image Polarity (IP)

    Note: The IP command is deprecated.

    The `IP` command is responsible for setting the polarity for the entire image. It is
    designed to be used only once, preferably at the very beginning of the file.

    #### 7.1.3.1 Positive Image Polarity
    Under the positive image polarity:
    - The image is generated in accordance with the specifications provided elsewhere in
        this document.
    - It's worth noting that, by default, image generation has always assumed a positive
        image polarity.

    #### 7.1.3.2 Negative Image Polarity
    When the negative image polarity is in use:
    - The intent is to produce an image that portrays clear areas against a dark
        backdrop.
    - The initial state of the entire image plane is dark, as opposed to being clear.
    - The polarity effects between dark and clear regions are interchanged. Essentially,
        what was dark becomes white and vice-versa.
    - For negative image polarity, the very first graphics object that gets produced
        must possess a dark polarity. As a result, it takes on the role of clearing the
        dark backdrop.
