## Information about the hardware schematics, design sources, and revision changes

PDF exports of the schematics are found in this folder. Deisgn files are found in the
folders, each folder features all required files for a specific hardware revision as
indicated by the folder name. To access the design files you need the latest beta
version of KiCAD. Using the latest stable version usually will NOT suffice.

The initial release of A64-OLinuXino boards was revision C. The six variants of the
board so far are:

- A64-OLinuXino-1G with 1GB RAM but NO flash and NO WiFi/BLE connectivity

- A64-OLinuXino-1Ge16GW with 1GB RAM and 16GB extra eMMC flash and extra WiFi/BLE module

- A64-OLinuXino-1Ge16GW-EA with 1GB RAM and 16GB extra eMMC flash and extra WiFi/BLE
  module + external antenna

- A64-OLinuXino-1Ge4GW with 1GB RAM and 4GB extra eMMC flash and extra WiFi/BLE module

- A64-OLinuXino-1Gs16M with 1GB RAM, no NAND or eMMC flash, no WiFi/BLE, extra 16MB SPI
  flash

- A64-OLinuXino-2Ge8G-IND with 2GB RAM and 8GB extra flash but NO WiFi/BLE connectivity;
  with components that work in the industrial -40+85C temperature range

### Hardware revision changes log:

#### Hardware revision E

- 1. Changed the eMMC from eMMC (4GB,1.00mm pitch) to eMMC (16GB,0.50mm pitch). Some of
     the surrounding components changed too. \*\* 1.1 Removed
     RM1(RA1206*(4X0603)\_4B8_10k), RM2(RA0805*(4X0402)_22R), RM3(RA0805_(4X0402)_22R),
     RM4(RA1206_(4X0603)_4B8_10k), RM5(RA0805_(4X0402)\_22R)
- 2. C212 and C213 were changed from 27pF to 33pF and from 0603 to 0402 as component
     optimisation.

     component optimisation.
- 5. C119 and VR1 changed from PTH to SMT type in the KiCad settings. In reallity, C119
     and VR1 did not change.
- 6. PWRLED1 and CHGLED1 labels corrected in the white print.
- 7. WP_Enable1 jumper added to the SPI_Flash.
- 8. U4 changed from NA(H27UBG8T2BTR-BC(TSOP48)) to NA(MT29F64G08CBABA-WP(TSOP48)), i.e.
     when populated 8GB NAND instead of 4GB.
- 9. MICRO_SD(TFC-WPAPR-08) package change - corrected cream layer and origin.
- 10. PWR_PC1 jumper state changed to Soldered(2-3); Opened(1-2) so that 1.8V wire is
      connected to the eMMC by default.
- 11. Serial resistors added to the Ethernet PHY's Tx lines for better EMI supression
      and RLC filters to the clock lines.
- 12. C198 connected to the right side of the RGMII_RXCLK line.
- 13. The Wi-Fi's baloun now matched with the same "Pi" - filter like in Teres-I, so:
      C105 changed from 33pF to 10pF C106 changed from NA to 0.8pF R62 was exchanged
      with inductor 3.3nH C107 was changed from NA to 1.5pF
- 14. The WiFi's antenna mirrored

#### Hardware revision E1

- 1. eMMC KLMAG2GEND-B031(FBGA153)(16G) changed with new eMMC
     KLMAG1JETD-B041(FBGA153)(16G)

#### Hardware revision F

- 1. Added R62(10k/0402) pull-down to the eMMC's data strobe line;
- 2. RM14, RA0805\_(4X0402)\_22R replaced by 4 resistors 22R/0402, i.e. R121-R124; R121
     was placed away from UEXT for to make shorter eMMC's data strobe line length;
- 3. R73[NA(22R/0402)] was added to enable SPI0 software CS option to the UEXT via PH10,
     when the SPI_Flash is populated. By defalut, it will reamin as it was, i.e.
     R124(22R/0402) populated!, while R73(NA)!;
- 4. L9 was changed from 2.7nH/L0402 to NA(2.7nH/L0402), and C88 from 24pF to NA(24pF);
- 5. MIPI-DSI1 changed: MIPI-DSI1 connector's pinout completely changed for Raspberry-Pi
     compatability; added the resistors: R125 to R132;
- 6. In the DRC drill to drill clerance was set to 12mils and all related errors were
     corrected;
- 7. UEXT1 was changed from NA(HN2x5) to HN2x5;
- 8. All 3Ds were assigned;
- 9. It was added C94(NA/0402) to the eMMC's clock line just in case;
- 10. NAND and related components removed forever;
- 11. In the schematic all "/" signs were exchanged with "\";
- 12. Improvements around the placement of a number of resistors related to the PHY
      signals to reduce EMI emissions;
- 13. Added U4 EEPROM - AT24C16C-SSHM-T(SOIC-8_150mil) and also C39, 100nF/10V/10% to
      the UEXT's I2C to avoid conflict with the same EEPROM on the LCD-Driver board. It
      is placed by default;
- 14. R15[NA(22R/R0402)] added in serial to the eMMC's datastrobe signal to be able to
      disconnect when no HS400 mode or to add a serial filter to reduce EMI;
- 15. UBOOT1, PWRON1 and RESET1 packages changed from OLIMEX_Buttons-FP:uTACTIL to
      OLIMEX_Buttons-FP:IT1185AU2_V2;
- 16. U2 and U3's packages improved;
- 17. LAN1's package improved;
- 18. D1 moved a little bit away from the PWR-JACK's + pad;
- 19. Q2 package changed from Q32.768kHz\12.5pF/20ppm/4P/SMD8038 to
      Q32.768kHz/12.5pF/2P/SMD1206;
- 20. L7 package changed from 2.7nH\L0402 to NA(2.7nH\L0402), and C198 changed from 24pF
      to NA(24pF);
- 21. R100 changed from 22R/0402 to FB1, FB0402/PZ1005U601-R45TF-1;
- 22. R69 changed from 22R/0402 to FB2, FB0402/PZ1005U601-R45TF-1;
- 23. The GND polygons in the top and bottom opened to allow for metal cover soldering.

#### Hardware revision G

- 1. Added antenna ANT2(NA(U.FL-R-SMT-1)), R16(0R) and R17(NA/0R);
- 2. Removed FB1(FB0402/PZ1005U601-R45TF-1) and FB2(FB0402/PZ1005U601-R45TF-1) and
     placed R18(22R/0402) and R19(22R/0402) resistors instead. Using FB1 and FB2 was
     meant to improve the EMI, but it yielded no results;
- 3. Adjusted the lengths of some eMMC wires;
- 4. C93 changed from 24pF to 24pF\50V/5%. C88 and C198 changed from NA/24pF to
     NA(24pF\50V/5%);
- 5. Changing 5.1 eMMC at 3.3V (up from 1.8V operation) for better reliability, PWR_PC1
     jumper has to be set to position 1-2 for 3.3V operation.
