PyGerber is a Python implementation of Gerber X3/X2 format. It is based on Ucamco's
`The Gerber Layer Format Specification. Revision 2023.03` (Available on
[Ucamco's webpage](https://www.ucamco.com/files/downloads/file_en/456/gerber-layer-format-specification-revision-2023-03_en.pdf)
and in
[this repository](https://github.com/Argmaster/pygerber/blob/main/docs/gerber_specification/gerber-layer-format-specification-revision-2023-03_en.pdf)).
The goal of this project is to provide support for wide variety of Gerber-like syntaxes,
with support for most of deprecated features along with support for modern ones.

### Target set of tools:

- [x] Tokenizer
- [x] Parser
- [ ] Optimizer
- [x] Rasterized 2D rendering engine (With
      [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow))
- [ ] Vector 2D rendering engine (With [drawsvg](https://github.com/cduck/drawsvg))
- [ ] Model 3D rendering engine (With [Blender](https://www.blender.org/))
- [ ] Formatter
- [ ] Linter (eg. deprecated syntax detection)
- [x] Gerber X3/X2 Language Server (with `language-server` extras)

You can view progress of development in
[Gerber features support](#gerber-features-support) section down below. All Gerber
source files which can be redistributed under MIT license and included in this
repository for testing purposes will be greatly appreciated.

## Installation

PyGerber can be installed with `pip` from PyPI:

```
pip install pygerber
```

Alternatively, it is also possible to install it directly from repository:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/Argmaster/pygerber
```

### Language Server

Since release 2.1.0 PyGerber now provides Gerber X3/X2 Language Server with
[LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) support. It can be enabled
by installing PyGerber extras set `language-server` with following command:

```
pip install pygerber[language-server]
```

Afterwards you can use `pygerber is-language-server-available` to check if language
server was correctly enabled. Please report all issues in
[PyGerber Issues](https://github.com/Argmaster/pygerber/issues) section.

## Command line usage

After installing `pygerber`, depending on your environment, it should become available
in your command line:

```bash
pygerber --version
```

Output should be similar to one below **â‡©**, where `x.y.z` should match version of
PyGerber installed.

```
$ pygerber --version
pygerber, version x.y.z
```

Use `--help` to display help messages with lists of subcommands and subcommand options:

```
pygerber raster-2d --help
```

To render 2D PNG image of some gerber file you can simply use:

```
pygerber raster-2d gerber-source.grb
```

Image will be saved to `output.png` in current working directory.

![example_pcb_image](https://github.com/Argmaster/pygerber/assets/56170852/9bca28bf-8aa6-4215-aac1-62c386490485)

## API usage

PyGerber offers a high-level API that simplifies the process of rendering Gerber files.
Whether you're looking to save the rendered output to a file or directly into a buffer,
PyGerber has got you covered.

- **The `Layer` Class**: At its core, the `Layer` class stands for a single Gerber
  source file, complete with its associated PyGerber configuration.

  **Important** `Layer` class represents **any** Gerber file, **not** layer of PCB. For
  example, silkscreen Gerber file will require one instance of `Layer`, paste mask will
  require another one, copper top yet another, etc.

- **Configuration Flexibility**: The configuration possibilities you get with a `Layer`
  are driven by the backend you choose to render your source file.

- **Selecting a Backend**: PyGerber provides specialized subclasses of the `Layer` class
  each tied to one rendering backend. For instance, if you're aiming for 2D rasterized
  images, `Rasterized2DLayer` is your go-to choice.

- **Output Types**: Keep in mind, the type of your output file is closely tied to the
  backend you select.For 2D rasterized rendering
  [all formats supported by Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html)
  are accepted.

### Rasterized render from file

```py linenums="1" title="render_file.py"
from pygerber.gerberx3.api import (
      ColorScheme,
      Rasterized2DLayer,
      Rasterized2DLayerParams,
)

# Path to Gerber source file.
source_path = "main_cu.grb"

Rasterized2DLayer(
      options=Rasterized2DLayerParams(
            source_path=source_path,
            colors=ColorScheme.COPPER_ALPHA,
      ),
).render().save("output.png")
```

Example code above creates `Rasterized2DLayer` object, renders it with rasterized 2D
backend and saves it as `PNG` image. Use of `Rasterized2DLayer` and
`Rasterized2DLayerOptions` classes implicitly use 2D rasterized backend. To use
different rendering backend with high level API, user must pick different `Layer` and
`LayerOptions` subclasses. For other backends see
[Target set of tools](#target-set-of-tools) section, note that only checked ones are
available.

`source_path` option accepts `str` or `Path` pointing to local Gerber file. No special
file extension is required, content is blindly loaded from specified file, so it's user
responsibility to provide correct path. There are also `source_code` and `source_buffer`
parameters which allow for use of raw `str` or `bytes` objects (first one) and
`StringIO` and `BytesIO` or file descriptors (second one). `source_code`,
`source_buffer` and `source_path` are mutually exclusive.

`ColorScheme` is a class which describes what colors should be used for rendering
different parts of image. Additionally it has a few static members which contain
predefined colors schemes for frequently used layer types. It is not required to use
predefined schemes, creating and passing custom `ColorScheme` object should work
perfectly fine.

Pattern of using `<Class>` and `<Class>Options`, like above, is used in many places in
PyGerber. When initializing object like `Rasterized2DLayer` it is only valid to pass
`Rasterized2DLayerOptions` to constructor. Passing `LayerOptions` or `Vectorized2DLayer`
will cause undefined behavior, most likely yielding no result or raising exception.

### Rasterized render from string

```py linenums="1" title="render_string.py"
from pygerber.gerberx3.api import (
      ColorScheme,
      Rasterized2DLayer,
      Rasterized2DLayerParams,
)

source_code = """
%FSLAX26Y26*%
%MOMM*%
%ADD100R,1.5X1.0X0.5*%
%ADD200C,1.5X1.0*%
%ADD300O,1.5X1.0X0.6*%
%ADD400P,1.5X3X5.0*%
D100*
X0Y0D03*
D200*
X0Y2000000D03*
D300*
X2000000Y0D03*
D400*
X2000000Y2000000D03*
M02*
"""

Rasterized2DLayer(
      options=Rasterized2DLayerParams(
            source_code=source_code,
            colors=ColorScheme.SILK,
            dpi=3000,
      ),
).render().save("output.png")

```

Code above renders following image:

## Syntax feature requests

All deprecated features (Mainly those from X2 format) are considered optional and
priority to implement them will be assigned based on number of requests form community.

If You needs support for syntax features which are not mentioned in
`The Gerber Layer Format Specification. Revision 2023.08` (Available on
[Ucamco's webpage](https://www.ucamco.com/files/downloads/file_en/456/gerber-layer-format-specification-revision-2023-08_en.pdf)
and in
[this repository](https://github.com/Argmaster/pygerber/blob/main/docs/gerber_specification/gerber-layer-format-specification-revision-2023-08_en.pdf))
and this feature is not already listed in Support paragraph, please open a new Feature
request issue.

**Feature request Issue should contain:**

- detailed description how requested feature works,
- code samples for testing the feature,
- reference images (only applies to features changing image look).

**Requests which don't comply with those guidelines will be considered low priority.**

## Development

To quickly set up development environment, first you have to install `poetry` globally:

```
pip install poetry
```

Afterwards you will be able to create development virtual environment:

```
poetry shell
```

Then You have to install dependencies into this environment:

```
poetry install
```

And pre-commit hooks:

```
poe install-hooks
```

Now you are good to go. Whenever you commit changes, pre-commit hooks will be invoked.
If they fail or change files, you will have to re-add changes and commit again.

## Build from source

To build PyGerber from source You have to set up [Development](#development) environment
first. Make sure you have `poetry` environment activated with:

```
poetry shell
```

With environment active it should be possible to build wheel and source distribution
with:

```
poetry build
```

Check `dist` directory within current working directory, `pygerber-x.y.z.tar.gz` and
`pygerber-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl` should be there.

## Gerber reference archive

This repository contains also archival reference files. Although new specs contain
dedicated changelog section it may still be helpful in some rare cases to look through
old Gerber specs. Archival files can be found
[here](https://github.com/Argmaster/pygerber/tree/main/docs/gerber_specification).
